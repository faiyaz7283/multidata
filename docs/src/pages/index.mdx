# Multidata Documentation
The [`multidata`](https://www.tradingview.com/script/99bYm1PC-multidata) is a powerful library designed to enhance data storage capabilities in Pine Script, 
enabling users to work with two separate data structures: [`data2d`](/_data2d) *key->[main|alt]* and  [`data3d`](/_data3d) *primary-key->data-key->[main|alt]*. 
These structures facilitate storing key-value pairs in a flexible and efficient manner, offering various methods for manipulation and retrieval of data.
