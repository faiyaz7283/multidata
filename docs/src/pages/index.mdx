# Multidata Documentation
The [`multidata`](https://www.tradingview.com/script/) library is a powerful tool designed to enhance data storage capabilities in Pinescript, 
enabling users to work with two separate data structures: data2d (key:value) and data3d (primary-key:data-key:value). These structures 
facilitate storing key-value pairs in a flexible and efficient manner, offering various methods for manipulation and retrieval of data.
